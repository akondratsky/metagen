# Syntax

Metagen uses its own syntax to define file and folder structure creation. It resembles the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#simple-expressions) expressions, but is much simpler and shorter: editing folder names is the process, different from editing text files, and the simplification here is essential.

Expressions in Metagen are also called nodes, but they use single braces:

```
{firstName} {lastName}.txt
```

Read about the different nodes in Metagen in the following articles.
